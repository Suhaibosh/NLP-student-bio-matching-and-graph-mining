# Student Bio Matching & Graph Mining
A Python project for analyzing student bios using text processing, similarity ranking, graph mining, and clustering. It ranks students based on query relevance using TF-IDF and cosine similarity, visualizes relationships between programming skills and certifications with NetworkX, and applies clustering techniques to group similar students.


This project analyzes student bios through natural language processing, similarity ranking, graph-based mining, and clustering. It enables querying student interests, visualizing skill associations, and uncovering patterns in student profiles.

## Features

- **Bio Matching**:  
  - Preprocesses student bios using tokenization, stopword removal, and TF-IDF vectorization.  
  - Computes cosine similarity to rank students based on query relevance.

- **Graph Mining**:  
  - Uses NetworkX to model relationships between students and their programming skills & certifications.  
  - Generates network graphs showing connections between students, languages, and certifications.

- **Clustering Analysis**:  
  - Applies KMeans, DBSCAN, and Agglomerative Clustering to identify groups of similar students.  
  - Helps discover trends in student interests and skills.
